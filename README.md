# DunderMifflin
A simple Dunder Mifflin database for demos or testing

This is a set of scripts and data files that pay tribute to everybody's favorite paper company, Dunder Mifflin. 

This database was built using the Microsoft Northwind database as a starting point, adapted to meet the needs of a small midwestern paper company. 

These scripts and data files are intended for demo use only.
